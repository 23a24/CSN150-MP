# In this github midterm project, I will be documenting my wireguard setup journey and how I got from point a to point b! And what I've learned along the way of setting up wireguard through ubuntu on digitalocean! This is very new to me so it was quite an interesting experience overall, wasn't as difficult as intimidating as it seemed at first, but wasn't really that easy either as some issues arose, all I got to say is you --MUST-- carefully follow instructions or you will NOT have wireguard setup at all on your ubuntu server or any server at all. I appreicate having this opportunity to try something new, more specifically this.
